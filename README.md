## Third assignment for my Software Engineering course.

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sclafus/ecommerce-gui/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sclafus/ecommerce-gui)

Developed with a [colleague](https://github.com/marticaffa).

This is a GUI app based on [Wine Ecommerce](https://github.com/Sclafus/Wine-Ecommerce).

It's using:

-   [JavaFX 11](https://openjfx.io/)
-   FXML files (with [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/))
-   Client-Server architecture (with JDBC)

This program is the Client of the architecture (clearly).

The Server application is available [here](https://github.com/Sclafus/Ecommerce-Server).

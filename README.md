## Third assignment for my "Software Engineering" course. Developed by me and a colleague.

This is a GUI app made for [Wine Ecommerce](https://github.com/Sclafus/Wine-Ecommerce).

It's using:
* [JavaFX 11](https://openjfx.io/)
* FXML files (with [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/))
* Client-Server architecture (with JDBC)

This program is the Client of the architecture (clearly). 

The Server application is available [here](https://github.com/Sclafus/Ecommerce-Server).

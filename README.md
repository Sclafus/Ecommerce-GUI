## Third assignment for my "Software Engineering" course. Developed by me and a colleague.

This is a GUI app made for [Wine Ecommerce](https://github.com/Sclafus/Wine-Ecommerce).

It's using:
* JavaFX 11
* FXML files (with Scene Builder)
* Client-Server architecture (with JDBC)

This program is the Client of the architecture (clearly). I'll link the repository for the Server application when it will be available.
